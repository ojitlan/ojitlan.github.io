### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 1 was one of my favorite labs because despite the amount of logic that
    was needed I was able to understand the assignment and finish it with minimal problems.

* Lab 11

    Lab 11, part 1 was another lab that I liked because it was a part of coding that I did
    not know well and I was able to see what some real problems may look like.

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 1 is the last lab that I liked because it was hard for me to undestand and
    was very confusing for me, but I was able to learn a little bit about something that was
    really confused me.
